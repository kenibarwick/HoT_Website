# Image Requirements

Please add the following images to this directory:

## House of Techno Branding
- **hot-logo.png** (Recommended: 200x200px) - House of Techno logo
- **Alternative**: Use the provided `hot-logo.svg` which is already included

## Artist Images
- **keni-dj.jpg** (300x250px) - Profile image for keni.dj (Keni Barwick)
- **dj-sportsbra.jpg** (300x250px) - Profile image for DJ Sportsbra (Mark Bowler)
- **keni-dj-large.jpg** (400x500px) - Full profile image for lineup page
- **dj-sportsbra-large.jpg** (400x500px) - Full profile image for lineup page

## Venue Images
- **balloon-pub-exterior.jpg** (600x400px) - Exterior photo of The Balloon Pub

## HoT Logo Notes
The website includes a fallback SVG logo for House of Techno (`hot-logo.svg`) which will display if `hot-logo.png` is not available. The SVG features:
- Animated pink gradient design
- "HoT" text with "House of Techno" subtitle
- Pulsing decorative elements
- Matches the site's pink accent theme

If you have the official House of Techno PNG logo, simply add it as `hot-logo.png` and it will take precedence over the SVG.

## Image Guidelines
- Use high-quality images (300 DPI minimum)
- Optimize for web (compress to reasonable file sizes)
- Consider WebP format for better performance
- Ensure proper lighting and professional appearance
- Images should reflect the techno/electronic music aesthetic

## Alternative Option
If actual photos are not available, you can use:
- Stock photos of DJs performing
- Generic techno/electronic music themed images
- Venue photos from The Balloon Pub's website or social media
- AI-generated images that match the aesthetic

The website will work without these images but they greatly enhance the visual appeal and professionalism of the site.
