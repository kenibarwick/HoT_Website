# üîê URGENT: Complete Google Maps Security Setup

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

Your Google Maps API key was exposed in the public repository. I've fixed the security vulnerability, but you need to complete these steps:

## üö® Step 1: Regenerate API Key (DO THIS NOW!)

1. **Go to**: [Google Cloud Console - Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. **Find your API key** (the one ending in `NFM`)
3. **Click "REGENERATE KEY"** 
4. **Copy the new key** immediately

## üîß Step 2: Configure Your Local Environment

1. **Update your local config.js file**:
   ```bash
   # Edit the config.js file (it's gitignored for security)
   nano config.js
   ```

2. **Replace the placeholder** with your new API key:
   ```javascript
   const GOOGLE_MAPS_CONFIG = {
       apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_REGENERATED_API_KEY_HERE'  // <- Paste your new key here
   };
   ```

3. **Save the file** (this file will NOT be committed to Git)

## üõ°Ô∏è Step 3: Secure Your API Key

In Google Cloud Console:

1. **Application restrictions** ‚Üí "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
2. **Add only your production domains**:
   ```
   yourdomain.com/*
   *.yourdomain.com/*
   ```
3. **Remove any** `*`, `file:///*`, or `localhost` entries
4. **API restrictions** ‚Üí "Maps JavaScript API" only

## ‚úÖ What I've Fixed

- ‚úÖ Removed exposed API key from public repository
- ‚úÖ Created secure config system (gitignored)
- ‚úÖ Added fallback display when API key missing
- ‚úÖ Enhanced .gitignore for comprehensive security
- ‚úÖ Provided config.template.js as reference

## üåê For Production Deployment

If using a hosting service:
1. **Use environment variables** for the API key
2. **Or** upload config.js directly to your server (not via Git)
3. **Never commit** real API keys to any repository

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues, the website will show a fallback map with a "View in Google Maps" link until the API key is properly configured.

**Priority: CRITICAL** - Complete Step 1 (regenerate API key) immediately to prevent potential abuse of your Google Cloud account.
